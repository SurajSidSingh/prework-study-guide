# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help assist students (or anyone who finds it beneficial) better understand the assigned Prework. While going through my own experience, I realized that it would be helpful to have had guidance of some sort. Therefore, I created this page to assist those who may need it. This study guide contains helpful information on HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript.
